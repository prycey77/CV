I have been fascinated with computers and software development since I was a teenager, and the Covid pandemic was just the push I needed to send my application to [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/). For the first time in years of being a very in demand professional double bass player in London, I had time to reflect and think about what I really wanted to do. My experience at Makers Academy has engrained in me the importance of best coding practices, and this is my biggest priority in looking for a junior developer role. I'd love to work in a supportive environment where those practices are followed. 

I fell in love with coding while preparing for my Makers inteview - the combination of logic and creativity, writing DRY code and producing tangiable results. 

As a musician, I have worked at the highest levels as a session double bass player. I have recorded 100's of film sound tracks and toured throughout Europe with some of the world's greatest musicians. I'm looking for a developer role where I can continue to work at the highest possible standard.

## Skills

#### Discipline

In order to become a professional double bass player at the highest international level, I have had to be tremendously disciplined, practising 3-4 hours a day for over ten years. I have a great work ethic and excellent time keeping skills.

#### Creative problem solving

Part of becoming a professional bass player is learning to practice effectively: that is, to understand and solve problems in an efficient manner, with rigorous attention to detail.

#### Team player

I believe being a good team player is more important than expertise. During my career as a musician and my time at Makers I learned the value of following Agile practices while maintaining good humor - even in high pressured situations.

#### Leadership

I have often been hired as the principal bass player of a section of upto 8 - Having to quickly make creative decisions and then communicate those with the other musicians.
