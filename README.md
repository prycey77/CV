I am a A software engineer and recent graduate of Makers Academy. In my previous career I worked as a professional freelance double bass player. After years studying and working as a musician at the highest level, I was unable to work due to COVID and I rediscovered my childhood hobby of coding. Solving problems through coding and tech gives me satisfaction I wasn’t getting from my previous career.
I’ve always been passionate about tech. The way it is changing our lives, the speed of change and need for continual learning really excites me. Coding challenges me in such a way that it drives me to be part of an industry that can make a real impact. I became a successful musician due to my self-driven nature and ability to collaborate well with others - these skills are key for any developer.

## Experience

**Self employed musician** (2001 to - )  
Double bass and bass guitar player.
[IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm8874503/)
I was required to collaborate and perform with musicians in many different genres.  


## Skills

#### Discipline

In order to become a professional double bass player at the highest international level, I have had to be tremendously disciplined by continually practicing and developing. I have a great work ethic and excellent time keeping skills.

#### Creative problem solving

Part of becoming a professional bass player is learning to practice effectively: that is, to understand and solve problems in an efficient manner, with rigorous attention to detail.

#### Team player

I believe being a good team player is more important than expertise. During my career as a musician and my time at Makers I learned the value of following Agile practices while maintaining good humour - even in high pressured situations.

#### Leadership

I have often been hired as the principal bass player of a section of upto 8 - Having to quickly make creative decisions and then communicate those with the other musicians.
