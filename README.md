I am a software engineer and recent graduate of Makers Academy. In my previous career I worked as a professional freelance double bass player. After years studying and working as a musician at the highest level, I was unable to work due to COVID. I took up my childhood hobby of coding and started seeing the potential tech has.
Iâ€™ve always been passionate about tech. The way it is changing our lives and the speed of change really excites me. Coding challenges me in such a way that it drives me to be part of an industry that can make an impact. I became a successful musician due to my self-driven nature and ability to collaborate well with others - these skills are key for any developer. I am currently contributing to an open source inventory manager app and learning key tech for 'DevOps' roles such as AWS, Terraform and IaC.

## Experience

**Self employed musician** (2001 to - )  
Double bass and bass guitar player.
[IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm8874503/)
I was required to collaborate and perform with musicians in many different genres.  


## Skills

#### Discipline

In order to become a professional double bass player at the highest international level, I have had to be tremendously disciplined, practising 3-4 hours a day for over ten years. I have a great work ethic and excellent time keeping skills.

#### Creative problem solving

Part of becoming a professional bass player is learning to practice effectively: that is, to understand and solve problems in an efficient manner, with rigorous attention to detail.

#### Team player

I believe being a good team player is more important than expertise. During my career as a musician and my time at Makers I learned the value of following Agile practices while maintaining good humour - even in high pressured situations.

#### Leadership

I have often been hired as the principal bass player of a section of upto 8 - Having to quickly make creative decisions and then communicate those with the other musicians.
