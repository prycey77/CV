## Richard Pryce

I have been fascinated with computers and software development since I was a teenager, and the Covid pandemic was just the push I needed to send my application to [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/). For the first time in years of bieng a very in demand double bass player in London, I had time to reflect and think about what I really wanted to do.

I fell in love with coding while preparing for my Makers inteview - the combination of logic and creativity, writing DRY code and producing tangiable results.

As a musician, I have worked at the highest levels as a session double bass player. I have recorded 100's of film sound tracks and toured throughout Europe with some of the world's greatest musicians. I'm looking for a developer role where I can continue to work at the highest possible standard.

#### Creative problem solving

Part of becoming a professional bass player is learning to practice effectively: that is, to understand and solve problems in an efficient manner, with rigorous attention to detail.
