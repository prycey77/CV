I had been fascinated with the idea of software development for years and the Covid pandemic was just the push I needed to send my application to [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/)! For the first time in years of bieng a very in demand double bass player in London, I had time to reflect and think about what I really wanted to do.

I fell in love with coding while preparing for my Makers inteview - the combination of logic and creativity, writing DRY code and producing tangiable results.

As a musician, I have worked at the highest levels as a session double bass player. I have recorded 100's of film sound tracks and toured throughout Europe with some of the world's greatest musicians. I'm looking for a developer role where I can continue to work at the highst possible standard.
